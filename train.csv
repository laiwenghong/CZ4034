Yup - $NQ_F should follow suit,1

"Still very much possible. In fact, I think its still likely.",1
"Yes - still confident in $ZM. Its only been 2 days. No reason to worry yet. Just remaining patient for now. Big money is made sitting and waiting, not trading.",2
"Unfortunately yes, we broke below the slop loss, so I took the loss on this one. No reason to overthink it - just bad luck. Cant win every trade. Just have to stay true to the plan and trust in the system.",0
40% in 3 day... truly insane!! Locked in profits today.,2
"Yup! Sold at $40 for a 50% profit in 4 days. Best to not get greedy. It definitely could go higher, but there are opportunities elsewhere, and its good practice to stay true to the original plan.",2
I love them both. Im in agreement with on $V and $MA.,2
We have not had a major market top in the past 6 month...,0
Yup. Just staying patient. Everything still looks good.,2
"Because my original plan when entering the stock was to exit at $170. If I didnt exit my position here, I would be breaking my original plan.",1
"Its a crazy short squeeze. But I dont like playing with stocks like that. The R/R just isnt favorable at these levels. And with so much hype around it, its tough to tell what will happen. Best to stay away in my opinion.",0

Yes. Those are potential opportunities as well. Ill likely post another plan once we come into the late stages of wave 4.,1
Thanks man. I appreciate it!,1
Legendary!! Congrads on the big win!!,1

Hard to say this early. Will update once we get more price data.,1
Ill do an update when we get there... but it wont be pretty...,0
It wont be short term too. Itll definitely be a multi-year high. Itll likely be a depression on par with 1929.,0
No indicator. Just Elliott Wave Theory in application.,1
Its in accordance with count...,1
Time will tell.... should be interesting,1
Thanks Trigger!! Should be fun...,1
"Im expecting $SPX and $NDX to peak by the end of February. All other equities will likely follow suit. Prior to the peak, we will likely have a euphoric rally... this is when stocks like $PLTR will shine... Ill link the $SPX analysis below",2
"Yeah, its been painful to wait on this one. Ive been seeing the triangle for a while now too, but I didnt enter long till today because it just wasnt ready to breakout yet. But things look good now, so hopefully we breakout in the next few days.",0
$SPY will likely reach $400 at the same time all of these stocks reach their peak. Itll likely be a simultaneous top for all equities.,2
Since wave (e) can never break below the wave (c) pivot. And since wave (e) has the potential to not hit the bottom of the triangle before ending... Im just entering here with a stop loss at the wave (c) pivot... this is because I dont want to risk being left out of the rally,0
A truly phenomenal setup on $PLTR... Expecting a rally to $40+ by end of February!! My EXACT trade plan is shown in the chart below... Trade Safe and Expect more Trade Ideas soon - seeing A LOT of opportunities in the market at the moment!,2
Im still in $NVDA... we never traded below $492... so I was never stopped out,2
Looks like we are on track!!,1
Took a while... but patience pays,1
This looks amazing Trigger!! By far one of the CLEANEST setups Ive seen!! Beautiful alteration in complexity between wave 2 and 4... and the wave 4 triangle is a classic!! What an amazing setup!! No doubt in my mind that this is going to be a killer of a trade!!,1
Should be a fun day tomorrow...,1
Strong past few days - hopefully the we can maintain this momentum!,2
Yup! Same view here - loving for $COST looks right now...,2
Yeah... I have a ton of losing plays. But thats just part of trading. No reason to dwell on them...,1
Thanks Trigger! Always nice to get the validation by another Elliotition!,1
Same here! Unfortunately getting stopped out is part of the game... but this time around the count looks even more promising. Will be interesting to see what happens.,2
"Amazing setup on $REGN... If current projection holds, $REGN should trade $666+ by end of March A break below $467 invalidates this projection... My EXACT trade plan to capitalize on this opportunity is shown below Trade Safe and Have a Great Week!",1
Some wonderful setups here!! Great work as always Trigger!,1
"Great question!! At the moment, both are equally likely. Once we get more price data, we will have more clarity of which path has less resistance.",1
Love it Trigger!! 100% Agree!! These rules are pure gold...,1
Thanks Trigger!! Yeah a wave 2 pullback to $365 (golden zone) would be a gift from the market gods!! Lets hope we can get some sort of pullback soon...,2
Love it!! Seeing the same thing here... hopefully we can see some movement this week!!,1

"Yes, I will be adding more $BIGC in 2021 after the lock up expiration.",2
"Vroom $VRM continues to be significantly mispriced and undervalued. Tonight, Truist initiated coverage with a $58 price target. Vroom to see strong growth over the next 10 years.",2
Tesla $TSLA filed to sell another $5 billion in stock from time to time. They will probably sell directly to the S&amp 500 in a few weeks. This will bring their cash pile up to $20 billion.,0
Tesla $TSLA almost hit $650 today. The company now has a market cap of $608 billion.,1
